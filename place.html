    <img src="image/agra.jpg" alt=""> 
    <p> If there was just one symbol to represent all of India, it would be the Taj Mahal.
      With so many wonders in one place, it's a must-visit city for tourists in India. 
      The city in Uttar Pradesh is chock-full of marvelous Mughal monuments, like Itimad-ud-Daulah's Tomb and Akbar's Mausoleum,
      decked out in hypnotic inlaid marble designs from top to bottom.

    <img src="image/rishikesh.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Rishikesh has been on the radar for spiritually minded travelers since the late 1960s,
      when the Beatles spent time in Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram now an abandoned site 
      that has become an off-the-beaten-path tourist attraction for fans.
      The town is nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas on the banks of the holy Ganges River,
      and serves as a center for yoga and pilgrimages. Take part in the action, 
      or just enjoy the sounds of the temple bells and sightseeing from Rishikesh's two suspension bridges, 
      often guarded by assertive families of monkeys. Keep your distance.

    <p>One of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world, Varanasi is arguably the holiest place in India.
      Varanasi is one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world. Pilgrims bathe and mourners cremate recently deceased relatives along the river.
      The spiritual activities take place along the sacred Ganges River, where pilgrims bathe and mourners cremate recently deceased relatives in plain view of passersby.
      Tourists, on the other hand, find their own flavor of spiritualism taking sunrise boat rides,
      releasing floral blessings that float on the river, and watching the fire-filled Hindu chanting ceremonies from the steep ghats.

    <h3 class="Amritsar">Amritsar</h3>
    <img src="image/amritsar.jpg" alt="">
    <p> Amritsar, the "Jewel of Punjab," has made its claim to fame with its remarkable Golden Temple.  The Golden Temple boasts the world's largest community kitchen, which serves 100,000 diners daily. 
      Get there early to dance to blaring Bollywood music with locals in the streets. One of the holiest places in the world for Sikhs, 
      the gilded structure is a sight to behold, glistening in the sun and reflecting into the large pool that surrounds it.

    <h3 class="Ladakh">Ladakh</h3>
    <img src="image/lasakj.jpg" alt="">
    <p> Situated amid the jagged crags of the Karakoram and Zanskar mountain ranges, Ladakh offers tourists the chance to immerse themselves in an awe-inspiring alpine desert.
      Despite its difficult-to-reach location and isolation, the Buddhist-majority region has retained a unique cultural identity.
      Don't miss the nine-story Leh Palace, which dates back to the 17th century, and the Shanti Stupa a monument to world peace. 
      You'll see Buddhist monasteries and temples all around Leh's Old Town, and countless colorful prayer flags fluttering in the breeze.
