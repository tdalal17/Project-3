    <p> If there was just one symbol to represent all of India, it would be the Taj Mahal.
      With so many wonders in one place, it's a must-visit city for tourists in India.

    <p>Rishikesh has been on the radar for spiritually minded travelers since the late 1960s,
      when the Beatles spent time in Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram now an abandoned site 
      that has become an off-the-beaten-path tourist attraction for fans.
      The town is nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas on the banks of the holy Ganges River,
      and serves as a center for yoga and pilgrimages. Take part in the action, 
      or just enjoy the sounds of the temple bells and sightseeing from Rishikesh's two suspension bridges, 
      often guarded by assertive families of monkeys. Keep your distance.

      releasing floral blessings that float on the river, and watching the fire-filled Hindu chanting ceremonies from the steep ghats.

    <p> Situated amid the jagged crags of the Karakoram and Zanskar mountain ranges, Ladakh offers tourists the chance to immerse themselves in an awe-inspiring alpine desert.
      Despite its difficult-to-reach location and isolation, the Buddhist-majority region has retained a unique cultural identity.
      Don't miss the nine-story Leh Palace, which dates back to the 17th century, and the Shanti Stupa a monument to world peace.
